## Styling:

## Approach
my first approach was to create a working game before I started with styling. I then had a working game in day one but the code was terrible going up to 500 lines of code refer to app.js. 

in Day 2 I spent all morning and into the afternoon creating the new logic for the game.

Once completed I decided to start styling the game with pastel colours as I believe it is ashetically pleasing.

## Logic: 
I created an array of winning combinations that i could reference to by using a loop.

You will see that winCombination is referencing each index value of the arrays within the array in the winCombinations Variable and checking to see if it contains a X 

I also created a tally system that will display how many wins each player has made.

## Challenges & lessons learnt
one of my biggest challanges was recreating the logic after working out that the way I was originally creating it was not ideal as it was blowing up to 500 lines of code.

## Still to do...
- fix the name change system as when you click new game the names still stay the same
