Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game https://cliftonia.github.io/me/

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Approach Taken:

my first approach was to create a working game before I started with styling. I then had a working game in day one but the code was terrible going up to 500 lines of code refer to app.js. 

in Day 2 I spent all morning and into the afternoon creating the new logic for the game.

Once completed I decided to start styling the game with pastel colours as I believe it is ashetically pleasing.


Logic: 

I created an array of winning combinations that i could reference to by using a loop.

You will see that winCombination is referencing each index value of the arrays within the array in the winCombinations Variable and checking to see if it contains a X 

I also created a tally system that will display how many wins each player has made.

Features:

After creating a working game i decdied to add the following the features:
- Player Tally
- Name Change
- New Game button that restarts the player scores as well as the name
- Reset Button that will just reset the board keeping the scores and names changed

Styling:
- Highlighting the winning board combinations
- Flashing the winning player

Improvements:

When a winner is announced the game can be confusing with the colors
